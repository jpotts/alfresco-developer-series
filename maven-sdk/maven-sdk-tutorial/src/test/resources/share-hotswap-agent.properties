# Add a directory prior to application classpath (load classes and resources).
#
# This may be useful for example in multi module maven project to load class changes from upstream project
# classes. Set extraClasspath to upstream project compiler output and .class file will have precedence to
# classes from built JAR file.
# i.e. monitor /target/classes
# should work with extraClasspath=${project.build.outputDirectory}
# If not try

# Add a directory prior to webapp path (load webapp resources).
#
# Load web application resources (such as HTML, JSP, CSS, ...) from this directory prior to default processing.
# Use this setting to set to serve resources from source directory directly (e.g. src/main/webapp).
extraWebappContext=${project.basedir}/maven-sdk-tutorial-share-jar/target/classes/META-INF/resources;

# Load static web resources from different directory.
#
# This setting is dependent on application server plugin(Jetty, Tomcat, JBoss, ...)

# Watch for changes in a directory (resources only).
#
# Similar to extraClasspath this property adds classpath when searching for resources (not classes).
# While extra classpath just modifies the classloader, this setting does nothing until the resource
# is really changed.
#
# Sometimes it is not possible to point extraClasspath to your i.e. src/main/resources, because there are multiple
# replacements of resources in a building step (maven filtering resource option).
# This setting will leave i.e. src/target/classes as default source for resources, but after the resource is modified
# in src/main/resources, the new changed resource is served instead.
